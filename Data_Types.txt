Quantitative 
Quantitative Data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations and also data which can be statistically analyzed.
Examples: Height, Weight, Time, Price, Temperature, etc.

There are two types of Quantitative data, namely:
1. Discrete
2. Continuous

Discrete data is information that can only take certain values. Discrete data only takes on countable values.
Example: counting The number of people on the street, the number of students in a class We can't have half a student!, the results of rolling 2 dice Only has the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

Continuous data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists.
Example: The age of the person - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.

Categorical 
 Categorical are used to label a group or set of items or Categorical data describes categories or groups.
 Example: A car brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi – they show different categories. Answering yes or no for questions Do you own a car? Yes and no would be the two groups of answers that can be obtained.
 
 There are two types of categorical data, namely:
 1. Nominal Data.
 2. Ordinal Data.
 
 Nominal data do not have an order or ranking. Nominal data is a type of data that is used to label the variables without providing any numerical value.
 Example:  Nominal data include country, gender, race, hair color etc. of a group of people. Gender is a categorical variable having two categories (male and female)
 
 Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good).
 Example: Ordinal data include having a position in class as “First” or “Second”. Temperature as a variable with three orderly categories (low, medium and high).
